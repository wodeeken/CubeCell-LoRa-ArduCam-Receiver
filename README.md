# CubeCell-LoRa-ArduCam-Receiver

A VSCode/Platform IO project for the HelTec CubeCell HTCC-AB01 LoRa board that acts as an intermediary to an HTCC-AB01 board wired to an ArduCAM OV2640 camera running the CubeCell-LoRa-ArduCam-Transmitter program (the Camera) and the host computer running the Lora-ArduCAM-Host-App application.

# Notes

This program is intended to be used in conjunction with the CubeCell-LoRa-ArduCam-Transmitter(https://github.com/wodeeken/CubeCell-LoRa-ArduCam-Transmitter) and Lora-ArduCAM-Host-App(https://github.com/wodeeken/Lora-ArduCAM-Host-App) projects. This program should be uploaded to an HelTec CubeCell HTCC-AB01 LoRa board that is connected to a host computer via USB that relays LoRa data from an HTCC-AB01/ArduCAM configuration to the .NET Lora-ArduCAM-HostApp application.

# Usage 

1. This program was created using the PlatformIO extension for VSCode.
2. The HTCC-AB01 board should be maintain connection to the host computer via USB.
